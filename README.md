## ðŸ“„ Abstract
Title: Simulating Gradient-Index Cloaking and Phase-Only Holographic Camouflage for Computational Imaging
This project presents a dual-module simulation that explores two complementary paradigms in optical concealment and reconstruction: gradient-index (GRIN) ray cloaking and phase-only holographic camouflage. The first module models a spatially varying refractive index field that guides light rays around a circular cloaked region, demonstrating how engineered media can redirect optical paths in accordance with Fermatâ€™s principle. A paraxial ray tracer numerically integrates ray trajectories through the GRIN field, visualizing the cloaking effect and its dependence on refractive gradients.
The second module simulates digital holography using angular spectrum propagation. A synthetic background interferes with a randomized phase object to generate a phase-only hologram. This hologram is then used to reconstruct the obscured scene, demonstrating how phase encoding can digitally restore visual information. The simulation includes both the hologram formation and the reconstruction process, offering insight into wavefront engineering and inverse imaging.
Together, these modules showcase the interplay between geometric and wave-based optics, and highlight the role of simulation in understanding and designing photonic systems. The project reflects strong proficiency in numerical modeling, scientific visualization, and algorithmic designâ€”skills foundational to graduate-level research in computational imaging, holography, and photonic device engineering.
